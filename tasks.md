# Regs Checker — Tasks

## Active Tasks

- **Phase 6 — Full reset + re-seed + ingest + triage + extract + sync (READY TO EXECUTE)**
  - Pre-flight done: smart routing, title disambiguation, regulatory_category, 4 URL swaps, MN omnibus trim, ambiguity agent retired, Unicode fix, keyword expansion, confidence improvements, **model config UI**.
  - Model assignments configurable at runtime via `/dashboard/models` (no code changes needed to swap models).
  - User runs: `python scripts/reset_pipeline.py`, then dashboard Steps 1→2→3→4.5→5 (`--clear`).
  - 16 laws with still-quarantined source text will be skipped on re-ingest (see `output/law_texts_quarantine/NEEDED_SOURCES.md`).
  - Step 3 uses **6 agents** (ambiguity retired — findings embedded as `interpretation_risks` on obligation/rights payloads)

- **Obtain correct source text for 16 quarantined laws** — See `output/law_texts_quarantine/NEEDED_SOURCES.md`. Place correct bill text in `output/law_texts/<canonical_law_id>.txt`.

- **TN quarantine files contain TX bill content** — TX SB 1188, SB 2373, SB 815, SB 20, SB 1621 may be legitimate TX AI laws. Decide whether to add as new TX entries in `fact_laws.csv`.

- **Merge feature branch to main** — All work on `claude/onboard-government-project-3bq7i`. Needs review and merge after Phase 6 validation.

## Quality Improvement Backlog

### Phase 1 — DONE (2026-04-05)

- ~~BUG-4: Unicode normalization in evidence span verification~~ — Fixed. `_normalize_unicode()` + `_normalize_text()` added to `BaseExtractionAgent`. 27 tests.
- ~~IMPROVEMENT-1: Tighten ambiguity agent routing signals~~ — Superseded by Phase 1B (agent retired).
- ~~IMPROVEMENT-2: Expand triage keyword list~~ — Done. `_BASE_AI_KEYWORDS` expanded from ~50 to ~65 entries. `_ADJACENT_AI_KEYWORDS` documented constant added.

---

### Phase 1B — Pipeline Restructure: Retire Ambiguity Agent — DONE (2026-04-05)

**Goal:** Retire the standalone ambiguity agent. Embed ambiguity findings as `interpretation_risks`
annotations directly on obligation and rights_protection payloads. Zero additional LLM calls, zero
additional review queue rows, findings attached to the obligation they affect.

#### RESTRUCTURE-1a: InterpretationRisk schema + ObligationPayload + RightsProtectionPayload — DONE
#### RESTRUCTURE-1b: Update obligation and rights_protection prompts — DONE
#### RESTRUCTURE-1c: Remove ambiguity from extraction pipeline — DONE
#### RESTRUCTURE-1d: Update downstream systems — DONE
#### RESTRUCTURE-1e: Archive ambiguity agent — DONE (`src/agents/ambiguity.py` → `src/ingestion/_archived/`)
#### RESTRUCTURE-1f: Dashboard inline display — DONE (2026-04-07). Review queue shows risk cards with severity badges.

**Definition of done:** No new `ambiguity`-type rows after extraction. `interpretation_risks` populated
on obligation/rights rows where relevant. Existing `ambiguity` rows in DB still display. Tests pass. ✓

---

### Phase 2 — Analysis Tasks (human judgment required) — DONE where automatable (2026-04-05)

#### ANALYSIS-1: Build 50–100 row ground-truth eval set
Sample ~100 extractions across tiers/types, have a lawyer verify each.
Record in `data/eval_set.csv`. Gates Phase 3 + 4.

#### ANALYSIS-2: Investigate 856 genuinely non-matching spans
After Unicode fix deployed and extraction re-run: query zero-evidence rows with spans. Sample 20,
categorize failure pattern (adjacent passage? paraphrase? fabrication?).

#### ANALYSIS-3: Gap analysis on keyword-triaged "not_relevant" passages
Query `section_triage_results` where `method='keyword'` and `decision='not_relevant'`. Scan for
AI-adjacent terms not in `_BASE_AI_KEYWORDS`. Feed confirmed gaps to IMPROVEMENT-2 follow-up.

#### ANALYSIS-4: Check Orrick alignment for same Unicode issue — DONE
Confirmed `re.findall(r"[a-z0-9]+", text.lower())` in `orrick_validation.py` is immune to Unicode
typography variants. No fix needed.

---

### Phase 3 — Score Quality — DONE (2026-04-05)

#### IMPROVEMENT-3: Span length penalty in evidence grounding — DONE
Penalizes verified spans >50% of passage length in `src/core/confidence.py`.
- >50%: 20% penalty on evidence_score (×0.80); `broad_spans=True` in breakdown
- >75%: 40% penalty on evidence_score (×0.60); `broad_spans=True` in breakdown
- Only verified spans count; unverified spans and absent `passage_text` skip penalty gracefully
- `broad_spans` flag propagated through both Orrick-gated (Tier D) and normal paths

#### IMPROVEMENT-4: Section reference quality sub-signal — DONE
`_score_section_reference()` scores specificity of `section_reference` field (0.0–1.0):
- 1.0: § + subsection detail (e.g. `§ 6-1-1702(3)(a)`) or nested paren notation
- 0.6: § symbol or clear numeric citation without subsection
- 0.3: generic label only (Section X, Part Y, Article Z)
- 0.2: unrecognized non-empty pattern; 0.0: empty/absent
Blended into completeness at 20% weight — no weight-sum changes.
`section_ref_quality` reported in `ConfidenceBreakdown`.
23 tests in `tests/unit/test_confidence_improvements.py`.

---

### Phase 3B — Dashboard Model Configuration — DONE (2026-04-07)

New `/dashboard/models` page for runtime agent ↔ model assignment:
- Scans LM Studio `/v1/models` for available models
- Per-agent controls: model, max_tokens, context_length, temperature
- Persists to `config/agent_models.json`, reloads agents immediately
- Reset to Defaults button
- `BaseExtractionAgent` gains `max_tokens_override` + `temperature_override`
- `_get_agents()` reads config at instantiation; `reload_agents()` for hot-reload

---

### Phase 4 — Model & Prompt Improvements (requires eval set)

#### IMPROVEMENT-5: Model comparison on eval set
Now easy to A/B test via the Models page — load two models in LM Studio, assign different agents, compare output.
#### IMPROVEMENT-6: Few-shot examples in prompts — `prompts/*.yml`

---

### Phase 7 — Product-Aligned Extraction (Multi-phase Restructure)

**Problem:** The pipeline extracts legal provisions (obligations, definitions, thresholds) but the
Policy Navigator product needs compliance decision-support data (does this apply to me? what do I
have to do? what penalty if I don't?). Empty/sparse product tables: `law_enforcement_details` (0
rows), `law_triggering_thresholds` (28 partial), `law_obligation_flags` (56, none derived from
extractions). Root cause: per-passage agents can't see cross-section context (e.g. the obligation
text references a penalty defined in another section the agent never sees).

**Strategy:** Add **bill-level agents** that run once per law with full bill text, producing one
structured record per law mapped directly to product tables. Layer on top of existing per-passage
agents — don't replace them.

#### Phase 7A — Enforcement Context Injection — DONE (2026-05-08)
Injects bill enforcement/penalty sections into obligation agent context block.
- `src/core/bill_context.py`: `_ENFORCEMENT_PATTERNS` + `_ENFORCEMENT_SECTION_PATH` regexes,
  collects enforcement passages into `bill_context["enforcement"]`, budgeted at 10k chars
- `src/ingestion/extractor.py`: maps `bill_context["enforcement"]` → `ctx["bill_enforcement"]`
  in both context-building paths
- `src/agents/base.py`: new `BILL ENFORCEMENT & PENALTIES` block in `_append_bill_context()`
- Decision gate: measure non-null rate on `obligation.enforcement.max_civil_penalty_usd` after next run

#### Phase 7B — Bill-Level Agent Infrastructure — DONE (2026-05-08)
- `src/agents/bill_level_base.py`: `BillLevelAgent` abstract base + `BillLevelResult` dataclass;
  reads model config from `agent_models.json`; LLM calling, JSON repair, retry logic
- `src/db/models.py`: `BillLevelExtraction` model keyed by `(document_version_id, agent_name)`
  with unique constraint (one row per law per agent, re-runs upsert)
- `alembic/versions/k7h3i9j1f612_add_bill_level_extractions.py`: migration creating the table
- `src/ingestion/extractor.py`: `_get_bill_level_agents()` lazy-imports agent classes;
  `_run_bill_level_agents()` assembles full text, runs agents, upserts; called after each dv loop

#### Phase 7C — Enforcement Agent — DONE (2026-05-08)
`src/agents/enforcement_agent.py` — `EnforcementAgent` (1024 max_tokens)
- Extracts: `enforcing_body`, `max_civil_penalty_usd`, `penalty_per`, `cure_period_days`,
  `private_right_of_action`, `criminal_penalties`, `enforcement_text`
- Maps to `law_enforcement_details`

#### Phase 7D — Applicability Agent — DONE (2026-05-08)
`src/agents/applicability_agent.py` — `ApplicabilityAgent` (2048 max_tokens)
- Extracts: `covered_entity_types`, `covered_sectors`, `ai_system_types_in_scope`,
  `size_thresholds` (revenue/employees/data/FLOPS), `geographic_scope`, `key_exemptions`,
  `government_only`
- Maps to `law_triggering_thresholds`, feeds `anonymous_audit_profiles` matching

#### Phase 7E — Compliance Timeline Agent — DONE (2026-05-08)
`src/agents/compliance_timeline_agent.py` — `ComplianceTimelineAgent` (2048 max_tokens)
- Extracts: `law_effective_date`, `enforcement_start_date`, `key_deadlines[]`,
  `impact_assessment_frequency_months`, `consumer_request_response_days`, `cure_period_days`
- Maps to `law_obligation_flags` + LawCard deadline view

#### Phase 7F — Threshold Agent Restructure (~2-3d, lower priority)
Split flat `threshold_type` output into three sub-types with distinct schemas:
- **Scope thresholds** → `law_triggering_thresholds` (revenue, employees, processing volume, FLOPS)
- **Temporal thresholds** → Phase 7E timeline (deadlines, frequencies, response windows)
- **Exemptions** → `law_triggering_thresholds.exemptions` (carve-outs, safe harbors, excluded entities)
- Migration path required for existing 28 rows in `law_triggering_thresholds`

#### Phase 7G — Safe Harbor + Missing Data Types — DONE (2026-05-08)
Added to `src/schemas/extraction.py` + updated all affected prompts:
- **`SafeHarbor`** model (framework, conditions, protection, evidence_text) → `ObligationPayload.safe_harbor`
- **`ConsentRequirement`** model (consent_type, timing, method, subject_matter) → `ObligationPayload.consent_requirements`
- **`protected_categories: list[str]`** → `RightsProtectionPayload` (consumer, employee, candidate, student, patient, minor, tenant, borrower, job_applicant)
- **`retention_period_months: int`** + **`retention_subject: str`** → `ComplianceMechanismPayload` alongside existing `record_retention_period` text field
- **`CrossLawReference`** model (reference_type, law_name, section, description) + **`cross_law_refs: list`** → `PreemptionSignalPayload`
- **`incident_reporting_hours`** already in schema — prompt now explicitly surfaces X-hour/X-day windows
- `preemption.yml` gained a full `system_prompt` (was missing); documents cross_law_refs vocabulary
- All new fields are optional (None/[]) — existing extractions remain valid

#### Sequencing & Decision Gates
- 7A is independent, ship first.
- 7B is a prerequisite for 7C, 7D, 7E (do it once, three agents reuse it).
- 7C/7D/7E are independent of each other after 7B — can parallelize if desired.
- 7F and 7G are layered enhancements; defer until bill-level pattern is validated.
- After each new agent ships, measure product-table population rate before proceeding to the next.

## Blocked Tasks
- **Cross-validation scoring** — Needs extraction to complete.
- **Phase 4** — Requires eval set (ANALYSIS-1).

## Questions / Clarifications Needed
- Sync to Policy Navigator: all types or approved-only?
- Is MinIO/S3 actually needed? Pipeline works without it.
- Who performs lawyer review for eval set (ANALYSIS-1)?

## Next Tasks (after extraction completes)

- **Sync local → Supabase** — Dashboard Step 5.
- **Sync Regs Checker → Policy Navigator** — Dashboard Step 6.
- **Run rollup matrix** — `python -m src.scripts.rollup_matrix`
- **Review test coverage** — 450 pass, 7 fail (pre-existing). 4 stale import files.

## Bugs / Issues

### BUG-1: Laws missing Orrick data → auto Tier D — ACCEPTED
Only 2 Orrick laws + 53 IAPP active bills lack Orrick data. The 53 IAPP bills are pending legislation — the Orrick gate legitimately flags them. Accept Tier D for these.

### BUG-2: Failed extraction retry — FIXED
### BUG-3: Supabase sync "not configured" — FIXED
### BUG-4: Unicode normalization in evidence spans — FIXED (Phase 1, 2026-04-05)
